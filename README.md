# Dharma Desk üïâÔ∏è

Hey there! This is my little passion project - a browser extension that turns your new tab into something more meaningful than just a blank page or random news feed.

## What's this about?

I got tired of opening new tabs and seeing the same boring stuff. So I built something that combines productivity with a bit of spiritual wisdom. Every time you open a new tab, you get:

- A beautiful space to track your daily goals
- Random quotes from the Bhagavad Gita (because who doesn't need some ancient wisdom?)
- Quick access to the sites you actually use
- A clean, peaceful interface that doesn't assault your eyes

## Features that I'm proud of

**Goal Tracking That Actually Works**

- Add up to 5 goals for the day (trust me, more than that is just setting yourself up for failure)
- Check them off as you go and watch that satisfying progress circle fill up
- Only counts goals you actually write down - no cheating with empty boxes!
- Everything resets daily because fresh starts are important

**Quick Access Links**

- GitHub, YouTube, and Gmail right there when you need them
- Hover effects that I spent way too much time perfecting
- Colors that match each platform because details matter

**Daily Wisdom**

- Random Bhagavad Gita quotes that change daily
- Sometimes you need a moment of reflection between checking emails

**Search That Doesn't Suck**

- Clean search bar that actually looks good
- Works with whatever search engine you prefer
- No tracking, no ads, just search

## How to install this thing

1. Download or clone this repo (you know the drill)
2. Open Chrome/Edge and go to extensions (chrome://extensions/)
3. Turn on "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and point it to this folder
5. Boom! Your new tabs just got an upgrade

## For the curious developers

Built with vanilla JavaScript because sometimes you don't need a framework for everything. The styling uses modern CSS with some nice glass-morphism effects that I learned while building this.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json      # Extension config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html         # The main dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css          # All the pretty styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js           # The brains of the operation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icon*.png          # Hand-crafted Dharma wheel icons
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # You are here
```

No external dependencies, no bloat, just clean code that does what it says.

## Want to make it better?

I'd love some help! Here's what I'm thinking about adding:

- More wisdom sources (maybe some Buddhist texts, Stoic quotes?)
- Themes because not everyone likes blue gradients
- Better mobile support (it works, but could be prettier)
- Maybe some gentle reminder notifications?

If you want to contribute, just fork it, make your changes, and send a PR. I'm pretty chill about code style as long as it works and doesn't break things.

## Technical stuff (if you care)

- Uses localStorage to remember your goals
- Resets everything at midnight (in your timezone)
- Works on Chrome, Edge, and probably other Chromium browsers
- The icon is made with Python PIL because I like making things from scratch
- Responsive design that doesn't look terrible on different screen sizes

## Problems?

If something breaks, just open an issue. I actually read them and try to fix stuff when I have time.

## Why did I build this?

Honestly? I wanted something that would make me pause for a second when opening a new tab. Instead of mindlessly diving into social media or news, I get a moment to think about what I'm trying to accomplish today. Plus, those Gita quotes sometimes hit different when you're stressed about a deadline.

It's nothing revolutionary, just a small attempt to bring a bit more intentionality to the chaos of modern browsing.
